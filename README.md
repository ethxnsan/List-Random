## List
A data structure that is mutable (changeable) ordered sequence of elements. Defined by having values between square brackets [ ] 

ex:
```python
groceryList=["pie","takis","dino nuggets", "chicken tenders", "cheese", "pineapple", "sausage"] #List of strings each string separated by a comma
```

### Indexing List
Each item in a list corresponds to an index number, which is an integer. starting with 0.

ex:

`grocerylist[3]` outputs: --> chicken tenders

`len()` gives us the length of items in our list

`len(groceryList)`--> 7
